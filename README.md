## my first e-Commerce project [FreshCart] which is built using RestAPI's & React.js 

It allows you to create an account, log in to it, and then add your needed & desired products to your cart or save them in your Wishlist for a future purchase.
Wondering if you can use your preferred payment method? I have counted everything, so you can choose to pay either in cash or online.


#Features & Tools:



- SPA & Routing using react router 

- Guard to some components

- Authentication & Context 

- Form handling & validation using Formik & Yup

- Fetching data from the API, sending, deleting, and updating them using axios.

- Caching displayed items using react query for a better UX

- React hooks (useEffect, useState, useParams, useNavigate)

- Pagination using react query

- Generating separate meta titles & descriptions for each component using react-helmet

- Online Payment integration using strip payment gateway 

- Bootstrap & Fontawsome & toast & slick & jwtDecode

- Adding not found page.



I have built this project for testing & practicing, but I hope I can build a real one with additional features soon
